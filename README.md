# Machine Learning Based Student Academic Performance Prediction
This project addresses the challenge of predicting students academic performance using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key factors influencing academic achievement and to build predictive models with optimal accuracy.

To achieve this, four machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared: **Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.** Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Several data preprocessing techniques are applied to improve model quality, including feature scaling, discretization, SMOTE to handle imbalanced data, and cross-validation to ensure better generalization. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize each algorithm.

The results demonstrate that this approach effectively enhances predictive performance and provides valuable insights for educational institutions in designing strategies to improve student learning outcomes.
